## ⚠️ Data Quality Issues (Intentional for Validation Testing)

### 1. **Missing Values** (5.6% of pollutant measurements)

- **Purpose**: Test handling of incomplete datasets
- **Pattern**: Random missing values across all pollutants
- **Real-world Cause**: Sensor maintenance, calibration periods, equipment failures

### 2. **Impossible Negative Values**

- **Example**: SO₂ = -10.38 μg/m³
- **Purpose**: Test range validation
- **Real-world Cause**: Sensor calibration errors, electronic interference

### 3. **Extreme Values**

- **Examples**: PM2.5 = 5,774 μg/m³, NO₂ = 10,050 μg/m³
- **Purpose**: Test outlier detection
- **Real-world Cause**: Sensor malfunction, extreme pollution events

### 4. **Scientific Inconsistencies**

- **Example**: PM2.5 > PM10 (physically impossible)
- **Purpose**: Test scientific validation rules
- **Real-world Cause**: Different sensor calibration, measurement timing issues

### 5. **Temporal Anomalies**

- **Pattern**: Some future timestamps
- **Purpose**: Test temporal validation
- **Real-world Cause**: System clock errors, data processing mistakes

## 🔬 Scientific Validation Rules

### 1. **Physical Constraints**

- All pollutant concentrations must be ≥ 0
- PM2.5 must be ≤ PM10 (fine particles are subset of coarse particles)
- Temperature must be within realistic atmospheric range
- Humidity must be 0-100%

### 2. **Correlation Patterns**

- Higher pollution typically correlates with:
  - Lower visibility
  - Lower wind speeds
  - Industrial/traffic station types
  - Winter seasons and rush hour times

### 3. **Seasonal Patterns**

- **Winter** (Nov-Feb): Higher pollution due to:
  - Reduced atmospheric mixing
  - Increased heating activities
  - Crop burning (regional)
- **Summer/Monsoon** (Jun-Sep): Lower pollution due to:
  - Better atmospheric dispersion
  - Rain washout effect

### 4. **Daily Patterns**

- **Rush Hours** (7-9 AM, 6-8 PM): Higher traffic-related pollutants
- **Afternoon** (2-4 PM): Higher ozone due to photochemical formation
- **Night** (10 PM-6 AM): Lower pollution due to reduced activities
